	<h4>About Us</h4>
		<h6>The Indian Government classified domestic violence shelter and support services 
	as “essential” – an important step in COVID-19 response. During the first and second waves of the pandemic, 
	700 One-Stop-Crisis centres remained open in India, supporting over 300,000 women who suffered abuse 
	and needed shelter, legal aid and medical attention.The current draft of the anti-trafficking bill that will be tabled soon 
	in the Parliament is another welcome step, as it is set to increase penalties for perpetrators 
	and make reporting of such crimes mandatory.
